My personal JupyterLite deployment for data science and machine learning projects, including breast cancer analysis. This site is deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages, allowing interactive Jupyter notebooks to run directly in your browser.

## About

This JupyterLite deployment contains various data analysis and machine learning projects, with a focus on medical data analysis. The notebooks run entirely in your browser - no server required!
